## 📊 Overview  

Los Angeles, California, is one of the most vibrant and diverse cities in the world — but with its size and activity comes crime.  
This project analyzes **crime data from the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD)** to identify **patterns in criminal behavior** and provide **data-driven recommendations for resource allocation**.  

### Key Questions Answered:
- ⏰ What time of day do crimes peak?  
- 🌃 Which areas have the highest crime rates at night?  
- 👥 Which age groups are most vulnerable?

## 📂 Dataset  

- **Source:** Modified version of [Los Angeles Open Data – Crime Data](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/fb1992cd-cf01-4cea-a0ad-cd477d93f0c3/edit)  
- **File:** `crimes.csv`  
- **Size:** ~ 100,000 × 12 (rows × columns)  
- **Key Columns:**  
  - `DATE OCC` → Date of occurrence  
  - `TIME OCC` → Time (24-hour format)  
  - `AREA NAME` → Geographic patrol area  
  - `Crm Cd Desc` → Crime description  
  - `Vict Age` → Victim age  
  - `Vict Sex` → Victim gender  
  - `LOCATION` → Street address of the crime

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used  

- **Python** → Data cleaning & analysis  
- **Pandas, NumPy** → Data wrangling & transformation  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** → Data visualization  
- **ReportLab** → Automated PDF reporting  
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Interactive exploration

## 📈 Methodology  

1. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaned raw dataset  
   - Extracted time features from `TIME OCC`  
   - Created victim age groups  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized crime frequencies by **hour, area, and age group**  
   - Identified **nighttime hotspots**  

3. **Findings & Insights**  
   - Peak crime hour occurs at **12 PM (noon)**  
   - Night crimes (8 PM – 5 AM) cluster in specific areas such as **Downtown Los Angeles**  
   - Most vulnerable victims are **young adults (18–44 years old)**  

4. **Report Generation**  
   - Summarized findings in a **professional PDF report** with charts

## 🔍 Key Insights  

✔️ **Crimes peak at noon** → Suggests reallocating daytime patrols.  
✔️ **Top night crime hotspots** → Downtown & nearby areas, requiring focused patrols.  
✔️ **Young adults (18–44)** are most targeted → Awareness campaigns should focus on them.
